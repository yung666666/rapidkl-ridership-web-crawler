RapidKL Ridership Web Crawler
This Python script fetches passenger volume data between RapidKL railway stations from the data.gov.my dashboard, processes it into daily and monthly ridership statistics, and saves the results as CSV files. It uses web scraping and parallel processing to efficiently collect data for multiple station pairs.

Features
Scrapes daily and monthly ridership data for RapidKL railway station pairs.
Processes data into pandas DataFrames with formatted dates.
Updates or appends to existing CSV files (rapidkl_daily_ridership.csv and rapidkl_monthly_ridership.csv).
Uses multithreading with ThreadPoolExecutor for faster data retrieval.
Handles errors gracefully with retries and timeouts.
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Installation
Clone the Repository (or download the script directly):

bash
換行
複製
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rapidkl-ridership-web-crawler.git
cd rapidkl-ridership-web-crawler
Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

Install Dependencies:
The script requires a few Python libraries. Install them using the provided requirements.txt:

bash
換行
複製
pip install -r requirements.txt
The required libraries are:

requests - For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
beautifulsoup4 - For parsing HTML content.
pandas - For data manipulation and CSV handling.
lxml - As the parser for BeautifulSoup.
Usage
Run the Script: Execute the script from the command line:
bash
換行
複製
python rapidkl_ridership_web_crawler.py
Output:
The script generates two CSV files in the same directory:
rapidkl_daily_ridership.csv: Daily ridership data with columns date, A_station, B_station, and ridership.
rapidkl_monthly_ridership.csv: Monthly ridership data with columns month, A_station, B_station, and ridership.
If these files already exist, the script updates them with new data or appends as needed.
Customization (optional):
To limit the number of station pairs processed (e.g., for testing), uncomment and adjust the line:
python
換行
複製
station_pairs = station_pairs[:20]  # Change 20 to your desired limit
Modify max_workers in the ThreadPoolExecutor (default is 10) to adjust parallelism based on your system’s capabilities.
How It Works
Data Source: Fetches data from https://data.gov.my/dashboard/rapid-explorer/rail/{A_station}/{B_station}.
Station Pairs: Extracts valid station pairs from a sample page’s JSON data, excluding "A0: All Stations" and self-pairs (A to A).
Scraping: Uses requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape JSON data embedded in the HTML.
Processing: Converts timestamps to human-readable dates and organizes data into pandas DataFrames.
Storage: Merges new data with existing CSV files, preserving historical data.

Notes
Rate Limiting: The script includes a delay between retries (5 + random.uniform(1, 3) seconds) to avoid overwhelming the server. Be respectful of the data source’s terms of use.
Error Handling: If data for a station pair isn’t found or the request fails after retries, it skips that pair and continues.
Performance: Execution time depends on the number of station pairs and network speed. Multithreading significantly speeds up the process.
